        "\n",
        "This blog post walks you through how to use DPO to improve open LLMs using Hugging Face [TRL](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/index), [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) & [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) in 2024.\n",
        "\n",
        "Research and experiments suggest that DPO should only be applied after SFT. This means we need an already fine-tuned LLM, which can be aligned with DPO. In this example we will use [cognitivecomputations/dolphin-2.1-mistral-7b](https://huggingface.co/cognitivecomputations/dolphin-2.1-mistral-7b) a fine-tuned Mistral 7B with ChatML template.\n",

        "2. Create and prepare the preference dataset\n",
        "3. Align LLM with TRL and the DPOTrainer\n",
        "4. Test LLM (vibe-check)\n",
        "5. Evaluate open LLMs on MT-Bench\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "_Note: This example is designed to be an introduction to DPO and TRL. It is build for a single GPU environment to guide you through the process. For production use, you should consider using a distributed environment. It should be possible to run the example on a single GPU with at least 24GB of memory by reducing the training arguments, with batch size, max seq length and run evaluation after the training._\n",

        "\n",
        "Our first step is to install Hugging Face Libraries and Pytorch, including trl, transformers and datasets. If you haven't heard of trl yet, don't worry. It is a new library on top of transformers and datasets, which makes it easier to fine-tune, rlhf, align open LLMs."

The `DPOTrainer` is a subclass of the `Trainer` from the `transformers` library and supports all the same features, including logging, evaluation, and checkpointing.\n",

The Reference Model is normally the same model as the one we are training, but frozen. This means for DPO you need additional memory and compute resources. To keep our example efficient we will use PEFT and adatpers. We load your fine-tuned and then add a new trainable adapters. This means that we will only tune adapters and not the whole model using DPO. The origian model will be then used as reference model itself. If you want to train all parameter with DPO you need to provide a `model` and `reference_model, but this requires more memory and compute resources.\n",
