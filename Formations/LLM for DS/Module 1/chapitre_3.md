## 1.3 Key Differences: Classical ML vs. Deep Learning vs. LLMs (5 min)

### Classical Machine Learning  
- **Data Requirements:** Typically relies on smaller, well-curated datasets.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Requires manual selection and engineering of features.  
- **Interpretability:** Often more transparent; decisions can be traced back to specific features.  
- **Typical Tasks:** Classification, regression, and clustering on structured/tabular data.  

### Deep Learning  
- **Data Requirements:** Excels with large volumes of unstructured data.  
- **Representation Learning:** Automatically learns hierarchical features from raw data (e.g., images, audio).  
- **Architectures:** Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for vision tasks and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data.  
- **Typical Tasks:** Image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and more complex pattern recognition.

### Large Language Models (LLMs)  
- **Data Requirements:** Pretrained on massive text corpora spanning diverse topics.  
- **Capabilities:**  
  - Generates human-like text, performs summarization, translation, and question-answering.  
  - Demonstrates zero-/few-shot learning, enabling task adaptation with minimal new data.  
- **Architectural Innovations:** Built on transformer models that leverage self-attention for processing sequences.  
- **Typical Tasks:** Chatbots, content generation, code synthesis, and other advanced language-based applications.
