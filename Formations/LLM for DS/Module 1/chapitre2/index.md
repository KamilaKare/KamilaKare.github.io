# Chapter 2: LLM Fundamentals

## 2.1  Introduction & Definition
### 2.1.1 Mathematical definitions

#### Reminder: What is a Probability?
A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of different outcomes in a random experiment. It is a measure between 0 and 1 indicating how likely an event is to occur. 

- **Example 1**: The probability that a fair coin lands on heads is 0.5 (50%).  
- **Example 2**: The probability of rolling a 6 on a fair six-sided die is $\frac{1}{6} \approx 0.167$.  

All possible outcomes in a given scenario sum to 1 when considering their probabilities.

#### Language Model as a Probability Distribution

A **Language Model (LM)**  can be defined as a probability distribution over sequences of words. It assigns a probability to every possible sequence of words $(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n)$. Formally:

$$
\mathbb{P} (y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n).
$$

- **Interpretation**:
  - A higher $\mathbb{P}(\dots)$ means the model deems that sequence more likely or more natural in a given language.  
  - For text generation, the LM can sample from this distribution to produce new sequences.

#### Chain Rule 
In language modeling, the chain rule of probability allows us to decompose the joint probability of a sequence of words into a product of conditional probabilities. This decomposition is expressed as:

$$
P(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n) = P(y_1)\prod_{i=2}^{n} P(y_i \vert _1, \ldots, y_{i-1})
$$

Here, each word $y_i$ is conditioned on all preceding words $y_1$ to $y_{i-1}$, capturing the context up to that point. This approach enables the model to consider the entire prior context when predicting the next word, making it **auto-regressive**.

#### Auto-Regressive Models
Auto-regressive models generate each word in a sequence based on the previously generated words. By leveraging the chain rule, these models can produce coherent and contextually relevant text. However, modeling long sequences can be computationally intensive due to the dependency on all prior words.

### 2.1.2 Evolution of Language Models

#### The Markov Assumption and First-Order Markov Models
To manage computational complexity, language models often approximate the chain rule by considering only a fixed number of preceding words.

#### The Markov Assumption
- The **Markov condition** states that: "The future is independent of the past, given the present."
  - **For sequence modeling**, this means that we only need the most recent context to predict the next word.
- The key idea is that the prediction at time $t$ depends only on the previous state, not on the entire history of the sequence.

#### First-Order Markov Models
- In a **first-order Markov model**, the probability of the next word depends only on the previous word:
$$ P(y_n \vert y_1, y_2, \dots, y_{n-1}) = P(y_n \vert y_{n-1}) $$

- **Example**: Given the sequence "I am going to the," the model predicts the next word based on "the" (e.g., "store," "park").

#### Markov Chains and N-grams
- **N-grams** are a generalization of the first-order Markov model where the prediction depends on the previous $N$ words.
  - **Bigram (2-grams)**: Depends on the previous word.
  - **Trigram (3-grams)**: Depends on the previous two words.
- Training an N-gram model involves counting the occurrences of word pairs or triplets in a corpus and estimating their probabilities.  In other words, in order to compute the language model, we need to calculate the probability of words and the conditional probability of a word given the previous few words. Note that such probabilities are language model parameters.

#### Issues with N-grams
- **Data sparsity**: As $N$ increases, the number of possible word sequences increases exponentially, leading to many unseen word combinations.
- **Limited context**:  N-gram models consider only a fixed window of preceding words (e.g., bigrams, trigrams). This fixed context window is often insufficient for capturing longer-range dependencies and nuances in language, limiting the model's ability to understand and generate coherent text over longer passages.
- **Computational complexity**: Storing and processing large N-gram models becomes computationally expensive as $N$ increases. This complexity can slow down processing and make the models less practical for large-scale applications.
- **Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) Words**: N-gram models struggle with words or sequences that were not present in the training data. When encountering these OOV words during testing or real-world application, the model may fail to provide accurate predictions or generate meaningful text.

#### Moving Beyond N-grams
- To overcome these limitations, models need to account for more extensive context, beyond just the last few words.
- The **neural network-based models** like RNNs were introduced to address the long-range dependencies that N-grams cannot capture.

#### RNNs and LSTMs

- **Neural networks** can be used to model sequences of words by learning patterns in the data.
- **Feedforward neural networks** were an early attempt at sequence modeling, but they lack the capability to capture sequential dependencies.

  - RNNs have loops in their architecture that allow information to persist across time steps.
  - At each time step $t$, the network computes a hidden state  $h_t$ using:
    $$
    h_t = f(W_x x_t + W_h h_{t-1} + b)
    $$
    where:
    - $x_t$ is the input at time $t$,
    - $h_{t-1}$ is the hidden state from the previous time step,
    - $W_x$ and $W_h$ are weight matrices,
    - $b$ is a bias term,
    - $f$ is an activation function (typically $\tanh$ or ReLU).
      
- **Challenges**:
  - **Vanishing gradients**: During training, gradients may shrink exponentially over long sequences, making it difficult to learn long-range dependencies.
  - **Exploding gradients**: In some cases, gradients can grow uncontrollably, destabilizing training.
  - **Sequential processing**: RNNs process one time step at a time, limiting parallelization.

#### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks

- **Purpose**: LSTMs are designed to overcome the limitations of standard RNNs, particularly the vanishing gradient problem.
- **Core Component â€“ The Memory Cell**:
  - Each LSTM cell contains a **cell state** $C_t$ that serves as a memory, allowing information to flow relatively unchanged over time.
- **Gating Mechanisms**:
  - **Forget Gate** $f_t$:
    
    $$
    f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)
    $$
    Decides what information to discard from the cell state. It combines the current input with the previous output to produce a fraction (between 0 and 1) that determines how much of the previous state to retain. A value of 1 means "keep everything," while 0 means "forget everything." This fraction is then multiplied with the previous state.
  - **Input Gate** $i_t$:
    
    $$
    i_t = \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)
    $$
    
    Determines which new information to add to the cell state. It also processes the current input and previous output, but its role is to decide which new information to incorporate. It generates a fraction (between 0 and 1) that is multiplied with the new candidate state (produced after a tanh activation). This product is then added to the previous state to form the updated state.
    
  - **Candidate Cell State**  $\tilde{C}_t$:
  - 
    $$
    \tilde{C}_t = \tanh(W_C \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)
    $$
    
    This is a vector of new potential values computed from the current input and previous hidden state, passed through a tanh activation. It represents the new information that can be added to the cell state after being modulated by the input gate.
  - **Output Gate** $o_t$:
    
    $$
    o_t = \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)
    $$
    
    This gate determines which parts of the cell state should be exposed as the hidden state. It applies a sigmoid function on the current input and previous hidden state to generate a gating vector, which is then multiplied with the tanh-transformed cell state to produce the final output for the time step.
- **Updating the Cell State and Hidden State**:
  - The new cell state is updated as:
    
    $$
    C_t = f_t \ast C_{t-1} + i_t \ast \tilde{C}_t
    $$
  - The hidden state is then computed by:
    
    $$
    h_t = o_t \ast \tanh(C_t)
    $$
- **Benefits of LSTMs**:
  - They can maintain and update long-term dependencies much more effectively than standard RNNs.
  - LSTMs mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, allowing training on longer sequences.
  - Their gating mechanisms provide a way to selectively remember or forget information, which is crucial for tasks requiring context over long distances.

## 2.2 Core Concepts

### 2.2.1 Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of breaking text into smaller units called tokens, which can be words, subwords, or even characters. Effective tokenization is crucial for reducing vocabulary size and managing out-of-vocabulary words. Common tokenization approaches include:

- **Word-level Tokenization:** Splitting text by spaces or punctuation. This method is simple but often leads to large vocabularies and difficulties with rare words.
- **Subword Tokenization:** Techniques such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are used to split words into smaller subunits. BPE iteratively merges the most frequent pairs of characters or character sequences to form subwords, striking a balance between vocabulary size and the ability to represent rare or unseen words.
- **Character-level Tokenization:** Splitting text into individual characters, which results in a very small vocabulary but longer sequences.

#### Example: Creating a Vocabulary using BPE
Let's illustrate BPE with a small corpus. Suppose our corpus consists of the following words:
```
lower, lowest, newer, wider
```
##### Step 1: Initialize with Characters
First, we split each word into its individual characters, adding a special end-of-word marker (e.g., `</w>`) to indicate word boundaries. The corpus becomes:
```
{l, o, w, e, r, s, t, n, i, d, </w>}
```

##### Step 2: Count Pair Frequencies
Next, we count the frequency of every adjacent character pair (including the end-of-word marker) across the entire corpus. For instance:
- The pair `l o` appears in "lower" and "lowest" (2 times).
- The pair `o w` appears 2 times.
- The pair `w e` appears 4 times (twice in "lower" and twice in "newer").
- And so on.

##### Step 3: Merge the Most Frequent Pair
Since the most frequent pair is `w e`, we merge `w` and `e` into a single token `we`. The corpus now becomes:
```
l o we r </w> l o we s t </w> n e we r </w> w i d e r </w>
```

And we update our vocabulary to include `we`:
```
{ l, o, we, r, s, t, n, i, d, </w> }
```

##### Step 4: Repeat the Process
We then recalculate the frequencies with the updated corpus and merge the most frequent pair again. For example, the next merge might be:
 - Merge `l o` to form `lo`, yielding:
  
```
lo we r </w> lo we s t </w> n e we r </w> w i d e r </w>
```


The vocabulary grows with each merge:
```
{ lo, we, r, s, t, n, e, i, d, </w> }
```

We continue this process iteratively. Each iteration:
1. Count the frequencies of all adjacent token pairs.
2. Merge the most frequent pair.
3. Update the corpus and vocabulary.

##### Step 5: Final Vocabulary
The process stops when we reach a predefined vocabulary size or when no more beneficial merges are found. A final vocabulary might include tokens like:
```
{ l, o, we, r, s, t, n, i, d, </w>, lo, low, est, new, wid, er }
```


This vocabulary now consists of both individual characters and subword tokens that capture common patterns in the corpus, balancing vocabulary size and the ability to represent rare or unseen words.

### 2.2.2 Embeddings

Embeddings are vector representations of tokens that capture semantic and syntactic properties. They transform discrete tokens into continuous numerical representations. Key points include:
- **Static embeddings:** Such as Word2Vec and GloVe, where each word has a fixed vector.
- **Contextual embeddings:** Generated by models like BERT, where a wordâ€™s representation can change based on its context.
