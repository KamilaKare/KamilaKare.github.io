# What is Generative AI

## 1.1 Introduction & Definitions 

### Defining Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Before diving into generative AI, it's essential to understand what artificial intelligence is. AI refers to algorithms and systems designed to mimic aspects of human intelligence. These technologies employ various techniques‚Äîfrom statistical methods to deep neural networks‚Äîto simulate cognitive functions such as:

- **Perception:** Interpreting and analyzing data from the environment.
- **Learning:** Adapting and improving from experience.
- **Decision-Making:** Evaluating situations to choose optimal actions.
- **Problem Solving:** Finding solutions to complex challenges.

### Transitioning to Generative AI

Building on these capabilities, AI has evolved into more sophisticated applications. **Generative AI (Gen AI)**, in particular, focuses on creating new content‚Äîbe it text, images, audio, or even code‚Äîusing models trained on large datasets. This innovative field not only enhances creative processes but also drives advancements in areas like personalized content creation, design innovation, and automated problem-solving.

### Contrasting Generative AI with Discriminative AI  

To better understand Generative AI, it's useful to contrast it with **Discriminative AI**.  

- **Discriminative AI**  aims to differentiate between different classes in the data. It focuses on making classifications or predictions. Given input data $X$, it assigns labels (Y) or estimates probabilities ($\mathbb{P} (Y|X)$).  
  - Example: A spam filter classifies emails as **spam** or **not spam**.  
  - Common models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and traditional Neural Networks.  

- **Generative AI**, on the other hand, creates new data rather than just classifying existing data. It aims to understand and capture the underlying distribution of the data ($\mathbb{P} (X, Y)$) in order to generate new data points that are similar to the original dataset.
  - Example: A generative model can produce entirely new emails that resemble human-written ones.  
  - Common models: GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), VAEs (Variational Autoencoders), and Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT and BERT.  

While **Discriminative AI** is excellent for structured problems (e.g., fraud detection, medical diagnosis), **Generative AI** unlocks new possibilities in creativity, automation, and data augmentation.
